## 1. Introduction

The optimization of cell culture conditions represents a fundamental challenge in biotechnology, requiring extensive empirical testing to identify optimal parameters for growth, productivity, and viability. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual experimentation and expert knowledge, leading to time-consuming and often suboptimal parameter selection processes. The emergence of intelligent automation systems presents an opportunity to revolutionize this field through autonomous optimization algorithms that can learn, adapt, and execute experimental protocols without human intervention.

Recent advances in machine learning and robotic automation have enabled the development of closed-loop experimental systems capable of autonomous parameter optimization. However, most existing systems focus on specific applications or require extensive manual configuration. We present Scale Me Maybe, a comprehensive autonomous cell culture optimization platform that integrates intelligent parameter learning with robotic execution capabilities to achieve optimal growth conditions for any cell strain through systematic exploration and learning.

The core innovation of our system lies in its ability to autonomously design, execute, and learn from experiments while continuously optimizing growth parameters. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined protocols, our system employs Bayesian-inspired optimization algorithms that adapt parameter selection based on experimental outcomes, creating a truly intelligent and autonomous experimental platform.

## 2. System Architecture and Methodology

### 2.1 Overall System Design

Scale Me Maybe implements a closed-loop autonomous optimization system consisting of four primary components: (1) Intelligent Parameter Selection Engine, (2) Robotic Execution Platform, (3) Real-time Data Acquisition and Analysis, and (4) Learning and Adaptation Module. The system operates through continuous cycles of parameter optimization, experimental execution, data analysis, and model refinement.

The system architecture follows a hierarchical design where high-level optimization decisions are made by machine learning algorithms, while low-level execution is handled by robotic workcells. This separation enables scalable optimization across multiple experimental parameters while maintaining precise control over experimental conditions.

### 2.2 Intelligent Parameter Selection Engine

The parameter selection engine employs a multi-layered optimization approach combining Bayesian optimization principles with correlation-based learning algorithms. The system operates on three primary parameters: mix cycles (1-10), mix volume (50-150 μL), and mix height (1-4 mm), which control the mechanical mixing conditions during cell culture passaging.

#### 2.2.1 Enhanced Bayesian Optimization Algorithm

Our enhanced Bayesian optimization algorithm incorporates correlation analysis to guide parameter selection. The algorithm maintains a probabilistic model of the parameter-performance relationship, updating predictions based on experimental outcomes. Key innovations include:

- **Correlation-weighted parameter selection**: The algorithm weights parameter combinations based on observed correlations between parameters and growth performance
- **Multi-objective optimization**: Simultaneously optimizes for growth rate, doubling time, and culture viability
- **Adaptive exploration-exploitation balance**: Dynamically adjusts the balance between exploring new parameter spaces and exploiting known optimal regions

The optimization algorithm operates on the principle of maximizing exponential growth slope during the log phase (OD 0.1-0.4), as this represents the most critical period for culture optimization. The system calculates growth slopes using log-transformed absorbance data and linear regression analysis, ensuring accurate quantification of exponential growth characteristics.

#### 2.2.2 Parameter Correlation Analysis

Through systematic analysis of experimental data, our system identified significant correlations between mixing parameters and growth performance:

- **Mix Height vs Growth**: Positive correlation (+0.319) indicating that higher mixing heights improve growth performance
- **Mix Cycles vs Growth**: Negative correlation (-0.231) suggesting that fewer mixing cycles result in better growth
- **Mix Volume vs Growth**: Slight negative correlation (-0.082) indicating marginal improvement with lower mixing volumes

These correlations inform the optimization algorithm's parameter selection strategy, enabling more efficient exploration of the parameter space.

### 2.3 Robotic Execution Platform

The robotic execution platform integrates with Monomer Bio's automated workcell system through Model Context Protocol (MCP) interfaces. The platform consists of:

- **PAA KX-2 robot arm**: Automated plate handling and transport

The system executes predefined workflows for cell passaging, media addition, mixing, and measurement, with all parameters dynamically adjusted based on optimization algorithm recommendations.

### 2.4 Real-time Data Acquisition and Analysis

The system implements continuous monitoring of cell culture growth through automated absorbance measurements every 5 minutes. Data acquisition includes:

- **Multi-well monitoring**: Simultaneous tracking of up to 96 wells
- **Quality control filtering**: Automatic filtering of data points using `consider_data` flags

1. **Experimental outcomes are analyzed** to determine parameter performance
2. **Correlation models are updated** based on new data
3. **Parameter selection strategies are refined** to improve future experiments

- **Stationary Phase**: Growth plateau with potential decline

Focus is placed on optimizing the exponential phase, as this represents the most critical period for culture performance.

#### 3.3.2 Growth Metric Calculation

Key growth metrics are calculated automatically:
- **Exponential Growth Slope**: Calculated using log-transformed data and linear regression
- **Doubling Time**: Derived from exponential growth slope using the formula: t_d = ln(2)/μ
