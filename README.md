# Scale Me Maybe

> **Autonomous Cell Culture Optimization System** for the [24hr AI Science Cell Culture Hack @ Monomer Bio](https://luma.com/qe0vfc7b?utm_source=ep-5UOLqHaRVT)

## Mission

Build an autonomous and intelligent system that **learns and adapts** to optimize growth conditions for unknown cell strains through automated execution on a physical workcell and AI-driven decision making. 

## How It Works

Beginning with an unknown cell strain, we systematically explore parameter combinations through automated cell passaging on the workcell, measuring biological outcomes to identify growth-optimizing versus detrimental parameters. Our Design of Experiments combined with ML methodology employs an explore-exploit approach to iteratively converge on optimal growth conditions.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Experimentation**: System designs and executes experiments without human intervention
- **Learning Algorithm**: Analyzes results to propose increasingly optimal growth conditions  
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Adjusts strategy based on experimental outcomes
- **Robotic Integration**: Leverages Monomer's MCP interface for direct execution on the Monomer cell culture workcell

## Instruments

- **Tecan Infinite Platereader** → data acquisition 
- **Opentrons OT-2 liquid handler + Hepa filter**
  - GEN2 Single-Channel P300
  - GEN2 Single-Channel P1000 
- **Liconic STX-220 30C incubator**
- **Liconic STX-110 RT incubator**
- **PAA KX-2 robot arm**

## Tech Stack

- **Lab Automation**: Monomer Bio robotic workcell
- **AI/ML**: Design of Experiments + Learning algorithms
- **Data Analysis**: Real-time absorbance monitoring
- **Integration**: MCP interface for Monomer workcell

## The Challenge

> *"How quickly can you onboard a cell culture you're not familiar with by leveraging an AI Scientist to look up protocol parameters and implement best practices while leveraging Monomer's automation to execute and test different conditions in a continuous optimization loop?"*

**Our Answer**: Create a system that doesn't just execute protocols—it **learns, adapts, optimizes and executes** them autonomously.

## Demo Goals

By Sunday's demo, we'll showcase:
1. **Live autonomous optimization** of unknown cell strain
2. **Real-time learning** from experimental data
3. **Adaptive condition proposal** based on growth patterns
4. **Seamless robotic execution** via Monomer's platform
